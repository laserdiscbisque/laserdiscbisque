# Who

Hi, I’m @laserdiscbisque. I'm studying for a diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology, and currently working a co-op job as a Low Voltage Technician.

Because this is the Github profile of someone trying to learn, I've done something a little odd: where applicable, I've attached my own perceived skill-level to any skills I've listed below.

# Projects

My current main projects are
- REPTAT: An automated climate control system for small animal enclosures and terrariums.
- babi: A native compiler written in CommonLisp for a custom scripting language with even stronger opinions about what should or shouldn't produce side effects

I am also repairing computers and learning Linux.
