## Who

Hi, I’m @laserdiscbisque, a Low Voltage Technician and an Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology student.

### School

I'm studying for an ECET diploma from the British Columbia Institute of Technology. I've completed one of two years, plus the Technology Entry program.

### Work

I'm currently working a co-op job as a Low Voltage Technician.

## Projects

My current main projects (outside of school & work) are REPTAT & `babi`

### REPTAT

REPTAT is an automated climate control system for small animal enclosures and terrariums. 

### `babi`

`babi` will be a natively compiled scripting language. I am writing its first compiler in CommonLisp. `babi` may have even stronger opinions about what should or shouldn't produce side effects. I am currently in a research stage and writing a pseudo-specification, which will be up shortly.

### General passtimes

I am also repairing computers and learning to use Linux.
