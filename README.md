## Who

Hi, I’m @laserdiscbisque, an Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology student.

Because this is the Github profile of someone trying to learn, I've done something a little odd: where applicable, I've attached my own perceived skill-level to things below. If the detail seems a bit much, it's because I mean to use my profile as log/journal for my professional development and some ongoing work such as repairing computers for my friends and colleagues, in addition to the usual repo hosting.

### School

I'm studying for an ECET diploma from the British Columbia Institute of Technology. I've completed one of two years, plus the Technology Entry program.

### Work

I'm currently working a co-op job as a Low Voltage Technician.

## Projects

My current main projects (outside of school & work) are REPTAT & `babi`

### REPTAT

REPTAT is an automated climate control system for small animal enclosures and terrariums. 

### `babi`

`babi` will be a natively compiled scripting language. I am writing its first compiler in CommonLisp. `babi` may have even stronger opinions about what should or shouldn't produce side effects. I am currently in a research stage and writing a pseudo-specification, which will be up shortly.

### General passtimes

I am also repairing computers and learning Linux.

## Languages

I trust my Python skills the most, but I've mainly used it for simple data analysis and basic scripting. Otherwise, I am mainly interested in Common Lisp and othe Lisp dialects, and low-level languages like C and Rust.
